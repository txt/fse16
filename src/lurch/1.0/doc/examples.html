                To install, unzip the download file,
                go to the new lurch directory, and compile 2lu.c:
<pre>
flex -o2lu.c 2lu.lex
gcc -o 2lu 2lu.c
</pre>
                From the directory in which Lurch is installed, run 2lu on the input
                file to create the executable <tt>lurch</tt> (a unique executable is
                created for each input file).  Then run Lurch.
                Here the input file is a model representing Dekker's
                solution to the two-process mutual exclusion problem.
                (This model comes from page 96 of Gerard Holzmann's book
                <a href="http://spinroot.com/spin/Doc/popd.html"><i>Design
                  and Validation of Computer Protocols</i></a>.)
<pre>
2lu models/mutual_exclusion_error
lurch
</pre>
                Lurch's output should look something like this:
<pre>
random seed: 1083095544

time  memory  states  sts/sec  % new  col  depth

0.03   1.60  8.0e+00  2.7e+02   75.0    0      4  _error

writing ce/_error (281)

0.20    1.73  1.0e+01  5.0e+01 (totals)
</pre>
                After 0.03 seconds, Lurch found the state in the model called <tt>_error</tt>.
                In this case the model contains finite-state
                machines representing two processes.  Each process has a
                <i>critical section</i> in which it would, for example, access a
                shared resource.  A third finite-state machine in the model
                implements an assertion statement, 
                monitoring the other two and moving to an error state
                (called <tt>_error</tt>) if both of the other machines are in their
                critical sections at the same time.

                <br /><br />
                At a search
                depth of 4 global states, Lurch
                found the error state.  1.6 megabytes of memory had been allocated
                when the error was found, compared to 1.73 megabytes total used by
                this run of Lurch (there is some overhead involved in generated the
                counter example trace file).
                Lurch tracks <i>saturation</i> (% new): 
                when the error was found, 75 % of the global states
                Lurch had found along that path were new, as opposed to redundant.
                This percentage gives us a rough indicator of saturation, i.e.,
                Lurch's transition from at first finding a great deal of new
                information to later finding nearly all redundant information.
                Lurch terminates automatically when the percentage drops below
                0.01 %.

                <br /><br />
                As with a model checker, Lurch creates a counter example trace file, showing the global
                state path from initial values to where the error state was reached.  Counter
                example files are put in the directory <tt>ce</tt>.
                <br /><br />
                Now create and run an executable for the corrected version of the model:
<pre>
2lu models/mutual_exclusion
lurch
</pre>
                No fault is detected, and no new trace file is created.

                For this model Lurch is run in asynchronous mode (<tt>-a</tt>).  <tt>-l</tt>
                tells Lurch to report no-progress cycles, or livelocks.  <tt>-c 25</tt> tells Lurch
                to run its cycle detection function such that a cycle must be repeated 25 times
                before it is reported.  Lurch uses an simple, informal notion of <i>fairness</i>
                that works with randomized search:  cycles are reported when repeated a user-specified
                number of times (to turn off fairness, use <tt>-c 1</tt>; strictly speaking, real
                fairness would require an infinite number of repeats).
                For a corrected version of this model, see <tt>models/process_scheduling_algorithm</tt>.
